# Project Overview

This project is implemented in a **single JavaScript file (~2400 lines)** due to specific requirements from the production team. While best practices in backend development typically encourage **modular architecture** (separating routes, controllers, and services into different files), this structure was intentionally chosen to meet the team's expectations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why is Everything in One File?
The decision to keep all logic within a single file was made by the **production team**. As a developer, I am fully aware of the benefits of modular architecture, including:
- **Better Maintainability** ‚Äì Easier to debug and update.
- **Scalability** ‚Äì Allows for project growth without becoming unmanageable.
- **Code Reusability** ‚Äì Shared logic across different parts of the application.

Despite these advantages, the project was required to follow a **single-file structure** as per production requirements.

## üîç My Approach & Knowledge
I have experience with industry-standard **Express.js application structuring**, which typically involves:
- **Routes:** Handling API endpoints (`routes/`).
- **Controllers:** Managing request logic (`controllers/`).
- **Services:** Business logic and database interactions (`services/`).
- **Middleware:** Authentication, logging, and security (`middleware/`).

However, since this project follows a **monolithic file structure**, any modifications should be made carefully to ensure stability.

## üîß Future Improvements
If refactoring this project in the future, a recommended approach would be:
1. **Splitting routes, controllers, and services into separate modules.**
2. **Implementing middleware for authentication and logging.**
3. **Using environment variables for better configuration management.**
4. **Adding proper error handling and unit tests.**

## üöÄ Final Notes
This project structure was a **team decision**, not a lack of knowledge in best practices. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contribute or reach out!
